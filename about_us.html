                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>
                    "We" am a student from a university in Malaysia. Yes, "we" is a one person, which is me, the creator of this website.
                    <br><br>
                    I am taking the Diploma in Computer and Technology, and this is one of my assignment for a subject. Therefore, <b style="color: red;"> 
                    any personal information you entered will not be recorded</b>, since this is a fake webpage for my assignment.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <h2>What is the purpose of this webpage?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am trying to build a shopping website that can provide a platform for anime figure collectors to communicate with 
                    each other, and buy their favorite character figure from this webpage and leave their comments. I hope that more people can understand 
                    nd feeling the fun of collecting figures. 
                    <br><br>
                    Since Hatsune Miku is my favorite character, so I created a whole webpage for her.
                </p>

                <br><br>

                <h2>How should I contact you?</h2>
                <p>
                    Of course the contact form that you fill out in "Contact Us" will not be recorded, so you can leave your comments and opinions about this
                    webpage through the email link below. I am a beginner in web development, and I hope I can improve my web development skills through this assignment.
                </p>
